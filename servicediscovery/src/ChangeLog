	* org/cougaar/servicediscovery/service/UDDI4JRegistrationServiceComponent.java:
	Remove ambiguity about threads and log fields defined both in
	superclass and containing class of inner classes by adding
	explicit "this" qualification to fields names. javac uses the
	field in the containing class where other compilers use the field
	from the superclass. Eclipse points out the ambiguity (since it
	was developed by the perpetrators of the latter interpretation.

	* org/cougaar/servicediscovery/lp/ServiceContractLP.java:
	Remove redundant type cast to quiet complaints by IDEA and eclipse.
